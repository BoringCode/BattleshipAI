# BattleshipsAI
A learning AI written in C++ that plays Battleships better than your best friend Nick from next door.

Run `make` to compile and `./contest` to run the contest. 

Unfortunately, the make requires several precompiled files (our professor didn't want to share his code). This code probably won't compile on your machine right now.

Made for COS 243 (Spring 2015) at Taylor University by Bradley Rosenfeld, Jacob Jin, and Zach Alford.
